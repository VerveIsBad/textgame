Textgame is a RPG/Rougelike/Stratagy game made in Python, and it runs entirely in the terminal.

## Playing

To play Textgame, you have to first download the repo, I.e, a quick:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/paytonthemartian/textgame
$ cd textgame
```

Then to run the game, you can run:

```sh
$ ./textgame
```

If it tells you something about 'permission denied,' try running:

```sh
$ chmod +x ./textgame
```

Then try again.
